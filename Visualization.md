# The background
Aiming at showing the public and policymakers the actual map of flooded regions, the interactive map showing the water level is designed
# Methodology and data source used
Here are some models I want to follow.
[Rhine Atlas](https://geoportal.bafg.de/karten/rhineatlas/) 
[Live Stream Gauges](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=81c5a9f2a2704d54a49042a44eefa5d3) Stream gauge observations of stage height and discharge contributed by the GIS community
# Details about the implementation
I do not know how they made the interactive map but for the basic visualization, here is the [code](https://github.com/be325/GRS35306/blob/main/Visualization.ipynb).
# Results
We only used Google Earth and Google Map in our project.<br>
I tried to use Python to visualize the water depth on the map, it succeeded but it is not interactive. So I will try to input data in ArcGIS to make an interactive map this weekend.

NOte: The data are fake.
# Conclusions both on the results as well as on the accomplishment of the goal
The visualization in the group succeeded but the individual is not successful yet.
