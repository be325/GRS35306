# A reflection on the learning process:
## Boundary Crossing Competence
## Aspects that went ok
## aspects went not so good:
1.	Technique Issues: there are only two members in our group who know how to write the code, so when one of them was sick, the process was slowed down.
2.	Operation System Differences: the code was written in MacOS, and it did not work on Windows, thus, it took us quite a long time to figure the errors (especially Numpy package) out.
3.	Conflicts between packages: 
## Potential use and application of the project outcomes

1.	The whole process, in general, is smoothy 
2.	The lecture focused on theory, and I was not practicing enough during the practicals and tutorials.
3.	It was my first time thinking about the ethic and societal aspect of using data, and there are far more things we should concerned about when collecting data from users or publishing results.
4.	The communication in the group is essential and needs to be done.
