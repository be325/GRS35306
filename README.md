# Introduction
## Original learning goals
- [x] Data wrangling 
- [x] enhancing the quality of the data
- [ ] visualize the real-time weather data and the flood caution on the map by using GIS applications

## Additional goals achieved
- [x] Acquisition of data from API
- [x] Learn basic Python and Machine Learning
- [x] Learn how to create, adjust, and change the environment in Anaconda
- [x] Fix the errors and warnings in the code 

The original goals were changed a little bit since we are not using any GIS applications, instead, we used Machine Learning. As the codes and explanations were uploaded as a group project, they are not included here.
