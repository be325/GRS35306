# Introduction

## Original learning goals
- [x] Data wrangling 
- [x] enhancing the quality of the data
- [ ] visualize the real-time weather data and the flood caution on the map by using GIS applications (half accomplished)
## Additional goals achieved
- [x] Acquisition of data from API
- [x] Learn basic Python and Machine Learning
- [x] Learn how to create, adjust, and change the environment in Anaconda
- [x] Fix the errors and warnings in the code
- [x] Learn how to use Python notebooks and basic writing and formatting syntax in GitHub

The original goals were changed a little bit since we are not using any GIS applications, instead, we used Machine Learning. As the codes and explanations were uploaded as a group project, they are not included here.<br>

To be honest, I would never have started learning data science if I had not taken this course. Writing code (with the help of ChatGPT) is easier than I thought. So I am very grateful even though I suffered from the group project.
