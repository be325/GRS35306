# A reflection on the learning process
## Boundary Crossing Competence
The connection between data science and environmental problems is deeper than I used to think. Indeed, there are many measurements and analyses, but as an MES student, I did not treat the analysis seriously. However, I found that it is impossible to be ignorant about dealing with data. Also, sometimes teamwork may slow down your own research, so if you can do the data analysis, it will save time and money.<br>
I finished my bachelor's in environmental science but from social science aspects, and when I was proposing my thesis, I just realized that data science could help to analyze the relationship between people's attitudes and actual behavior. As I did not take many courses about data analysis, I had to figure out how to conduct the factor analysis and structural modeling equation by myself. That is my first time combining environmental problems, data science, and relevant policy together to do the research.
### Identification
Flood prediction depends on real-time data from weather stations, river gauges, and remote sensing sources. However, even though many flood-prone regions have automated monitoring infrastructure, they do not predict the future water level. Thus, It is necessary to integrate sensors and visualization tools for a more responsive flood early warning system.
### Coordination
To create the early warning system, meteorologists and hydrologists must collaborate interdisciplinaryly to determine key flood indicators such as precipitation levels, river discharge, and water depth. Then, data scientists or GIS experts could design an interactive dashboard displaying real-time flood risk using Python-based machine learning models. Lastly, local authorities and emergency responders can ensure the system aligns with disaster response protocols and community needs.
### Reflection
Initially, challenges included data inconsistency as data were missing for no reason. This indicates that the data collection could be interrupted during the flooding period, making the prediction lack accuracy and reliability. Also, there could be sensor calibration issues but we cannot check this by ourselves. Thus, the raw data could be biased itself, leading to a flawed result of prediction and then slowed response. Further, the model's reliability could be differentiated in different terrains. Engaging in interdisciplinary discussions helped refine the data pipeline, ensuring accurate and meaningful alerts. I learned how people differ in considering the purpose of creating this warning system. As a student who was learning social science, I was concerned more about the communication efficiency with the inhabitants, while my other groupmates cared more about the accuracy of the prediction system.
### Motivation
To enhance my ability to cooperate with other experts, I would like to learn more about data science and improve my ability to analyze data by myself. Further, to avoid being blind during the analysis process, I will force myself to continue studying data science. It is also my personal willingness to learn more about the analytical functions in ArcGIS.
## Aspects that went ok
In general, the whole process was fine and we achieved our goal of creating the early warning system based on real-time weather data. During the process, I learned a lot within three weeks. The lectures on ethics helped me to understand why there are concerns regarding privacy and societal issues. The discussion with other groups also showed the diversity and variety of values people may consider when obtaining different data from different resources. To be specific, another group needs to get data from citizens for their mental health, so they are concerned more about privacy while my group focuses on how to make the accessibility to the dashboard equal.<br>
The discussion among groups helps us to think about our project differently as we are more familiar with it than other groups. When people who are not familiar with it ask us to what extent we can trust the system, it reminds us to take the model performance and accountability into account. Besides, as our project does not have many privacy issues, it is useful to explore others' projects to see those potential issues when collecting, analyzing, and publishing data.
## aspects went not so good
1.	Technique Issues: only two members in our group know how to write the code, so when one of them was sick, the process was slowed down.
2.	Operation System Differences: the code was written in MacOS, and it did not work on Windows, thus, it took us quite a long time to figure the errors (especially the Numpy package) out.
3.	Conflicts between packages: the necessary packages required different versions of Python, so we created several environments in Anaconda to fit the requirements, however, there were still modules (e.g., numpy._core.numeric) missing within the designed version of Numpy. Even though we tried to fix this bug, there was no information about it on the Internet. Therefore, we changed to Colab for our project.

4. Lack of practice: the lectures focus more on theory and the instructions for practicing are not very clear. Students who do not have basic knowledge of coding need more information about the practical steps. Also, one of my initial goals is to explore visualization in GIS applications. I found some [real-time flood maps](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=81c5a9f2a2704d54a49042a44eefa5d3) but I do not know how to make one.
5. Communication Issues: the communication in the group could be enhanced by telling others what they are doing to avoid overlapping work. Also, when dividing the parts for group members, it is better to explain what should be done since others may not understand the process clearly. Last, the problem being pointed out during the presentation (lack of warning indicating whether there will be a flood on the dashboard) was discussed with the person who made the dashboard, but he did not add that section to the dashboard. 
## Potential use and application of the project outcomes
The project was designed to make a flood early warning system and the application is to predict the potential risk of being flooded. The dashboard only shows the water level of rivers now, but when there is a predicted flood level, our system will be able to indicate whether the area is likely to flood or not. If it is possible to cooperate with the local municipality, it is possible to provide information about the availability and routines of shelters. In this case, the project could serve as an evacuation dashboard. 
##  Societal implications of using smart technologies
### Positives
1. Improve the quality of life: if natural disasters could be predicted and then avoided, people can save lives and wealth.
2. Enhance Public Safety: the initial aim of our project is to help inhabitants avoid being injured by floods.
3. Decrease car accidents: people could be nervous when they are in danger and cannot react correctly, but cars controlled by smart technologies could choose the best option to minimize the harm.
### Negatives
1. Privacy Concerns: data gathered from people posing individual privacy issues if they are widespread.
2. Cybersecurity Risks: the increased connectivity of smart devices creates vulnerabilities to hacking and data breaches.
3. Biased Accessibility: not everyone has sufficient access to the Internet all the time, and the connection could be interrupted during disasters. Also, those who are old and unfamiliar with modern electronic equipment could face trouble when there is a loss of internet connection.
4. Overdependence on the smartphone or AI: some people rely on the internet too much and they will be anxious if there is no internet connected to their phones. Besides, the development of AI helps students to finish their reports faster but not in good quality.
