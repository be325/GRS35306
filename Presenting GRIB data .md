# Background
The file downloaded on the KNMI website is in the tar. format 
# Methodlogy and Data Resource used 
Presenting the data in Panoply (a data viewer for GRIB files developed by NASA)
# Details about the implementation
1. Obtain tar. file from open data resource (see [Acquisition of data from API](https://github.com/be325/GRS35306/blob/main/Acquisition%20of%20data%20from%20API.md#acquisition-of-data-from-api)ï¼‰
2. Download Panoply from [official website](https://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/panoply/download/)
3. It requires Java 11 to run the application, if there is no Java 11 on the laptop, please download and install it. However, as there was no Java 11 for me to download, I used [JDK 23 ](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)as a replacement and it worked.
4. Open the needed file.
# Results
The information and visualization could be seen.

# Conclusions both on the results as well as on the accomplishment of the goal
This is an additional goal we set on week 1 since no one in our group knows how to read GRIB. format data. We accomplished this goal with the help from other groups.
